# How to fill the Flutter pie chart with gradient? (SfCircularChart)

SfCircularChart supports three gradient types: linear, sweep, and radial. Follow these steps to achieve those gradients in our chart using the onCreateShader event. The data points of pie, doughnut and radial bar charts can be filled with three types of gradient such as Gradient.linear, Gradient.sweep and Gradient.radial. All the data points in the circular chart are together considered as a single segment and the shader is applied commonly.
